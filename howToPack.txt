Once you are satisfied that your extension is finished, you need to package it into a NEX file, as follows:

Go to the browser address bar and type opera:extensions.
Make sure you have “Developer Mode” (located on the top right) checked.
Click on the “Pack Extension” button, located on the top of the page.
Select the directory of your extension
Click “OK”.
Your NEX package will be generated in the parent directory of the one you had selected. Congratulations!
